> ...Stepping out into the universe, we must confront the reality of interstellar travel. We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals but as a species. - Professor Brand (*Interstellar*, 2014)

To get curly brackets ( $\\{$ and $\\}$ ), use double backslashes to escape (`$\\{$` and `$\\}$`).
