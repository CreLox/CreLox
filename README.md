At long last, GitHub Markdown now supports [MathJax math expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions) natively (from May 2022)! To get curly brackets ( $\\{$ and $\\}$ ), use double backslashes to escape (`$\\{$` and `$\\}$`).
