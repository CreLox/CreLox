**Quotes I like**

> ...Stepping out into the universe, we must confront the reality of interstellar travel. We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals but as a species. - Professor Brand (*Interstellar*, 2014)

At long last, GitHub Markdown now supports [MathJax math expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions) natively (from May 2022)! To get curly brackets ( $\\{$ and $\\}$ ), use double backslashes to escape (`$\\{$` and `$\\}$`).
